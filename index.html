<p id="p1">Your'e literally my soul sister and I love you to death. I cannot believe we have been friends since the second grade in 2017. Like that's WILD to me. From our first hangout on our birthday's (I don't think that was our first hangout cause rember I saw you walking in askari7 and you told me where your nano's house was and then after that I thought of going to your house and I was so shy literally I could not ring the bell so my brother and mubeen uncle had to do it for me because I would go up to ring the bell and loose my courage and come back home and i did this like 10 times, idk why i was so scared and shy but i think we hung out like 1 or 2 or 3 times before our bithdays) and in Weplay to now the last time I'm meeting you, I've always had fun and thankyou for that. In 2027 in august we would have been friends for TEN YEARS. Some people's marriage doesn't last that long😭 I am so grateful for you keeping in touch with me even after I left harley because for me, I had shifted schools my whole life like every 3 to 4 years and didn't have contac with any of my previous friends, to me going to a new school and making a new bestfriend was a norm. I'm so grateful that you listen to me yap about literally evrything. I started making this website after the summmer break in eight grade but I could'nt continue because then I came to multan but now that you're going to Austrailia I guess it's time for me to show this to you. I just wanted to say that you're a very lovely person from the inside out so don't let anyone come in your way and you dreams. You bring a positive energy to my life and I want you to stay happy and even if you have sad days, you should know that I'll always be there for you <3 </p>

<h2 id="heading2">Some Poetry I Wrote A While Ago</h2>
<pre>
To the one who listens to me talk about useless things
When I'm with her, I feel like I have wings
A type of freedom I can't explain
Feeling serenity just like the falling rain
I could spend hours with her just sitting in silence
The places I have planned to go with her, once I get a license
I wish she could see herself from my eyes
For she is a beauty in disguise
I love her with all my heart
Hoping to stay eternal, never apart
</pre>
